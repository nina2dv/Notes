## Inspiration
I wanted to make a sticky note app.

## What it does
Input the title and description then click on "Add note" button to create a note below the horizontal rule.

## How I built it
I used React js and tailwind. It is then deployed on Microsoft Azure.

## Challenges I ran into
- Understanding how Javascript syntax works and how React works (useState, useEffect, anonymous functions, arrow functions)

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
This is my first time using React js.

## What I learned
I learned how to use React js with Tailwind and I figured out how to deploy this site to Microsoft Azure Static Web Pages.

## What's next for Notes
Fix the delete note feature as it clears all the notes instead of deleting one particular note.
